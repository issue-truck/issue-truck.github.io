The Horsehead Nebula is an iconic astronomical sight.

![image 1](/assets/img/2024-05-14-JWSTuncoversnewsecretswithintheHorseheadNebula_1.png)

Most nebulae are luminous: shining red and/or blue.

Energetic light ionizes hydrogen atoms, leading to red “emission” nebulae as electrons de-excite after recombining.

Neutral atoms also reflect bright starlight, creating bluish “reflection” nebulae.

하지만 호스헤드는 다른 종류의 존재입니다: 어두운 성운.

별과 별 생성 지역의 앞쪽에서 시원한 가스 구름이 배경 빛을 가리고 있습니다.

Their silhouettes create intricate “dark nebulae” against the illuminated backdrop.

With internal and external heating, infrared eyes reveal intricate features within the Horsehead Nebula.

However, with JWST's advanced high-resolution instruments, numerous new secrets are unveiled.

There are just as many background galaxies near the edges of the Horsehead Nebula as there are further away.



```

Individual stars appear to be forming inside the nebula, poking through the neutral gas in infrared light.

Some new stars are identifiable by their diffraction spikes in NIRCam imagery.

Other “lights” revealed inside, however, correspond to highly luminous background galaxies.

One includes a potentially active supermassive black hole.

Just 1300 light-years away, infrared views reveal the internal workings within the Horsehead.
